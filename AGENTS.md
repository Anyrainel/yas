# Yas — Genshin Impact Scanner

## Build Rules

- **NEVER kill GOODScanner.exe or any user process to unblock a build.** If `cargo build` fails with "access denied" because the exe is locked, tell the user and wait. If they confirm the process can be stopped, wait for it to exit on its own or let the user close it.

## Prioritization

- **When instructions are clear, implement them directly.** Do not block one clear item because another item needs discussion. Make all clear changes first, then discuss the unclear ones.

## No Piecemeal Refactoring

- **When receiving feedback that changes a design decision, propagate its full implications** — don't patch only the specific spot the user pointed at. If the feedback implies a different ownership model, naming scheme, or data flow, update all affected sites, not just the one mentioned.

## DRY is Top Priority

- **Never duplicate logic between test binaries and production code.** Core features (UI navigation, OCR scanning, filter operations, grid scanning) must be implemented as well-defined methods in the proper modules (e.g., `manager/ui_actions.rs`). Test binaries should only contain test-specific looping/reporting logic and call shared functions.
- When refactoring for DRY, **ensure logic equivalence** — the extracted function must behave identically to the original inline code.
- Prefer reusing existing functions over writing new code that does the same thing.

## Overview

Yas (Yet Another Scanner) is a Rust application that scans Genshin Impact in-game data (characters, weapons, artifacts) using OCR and exports it in **GOOD v3** (Genshin Open Object Description) format for use with optimizer tools.

## Architecture

### Workspace Crates

- **`yas`** (`yas_core`) — Platform-agnostic core library: screen capture, OCR (PaddlePaddle ONNX models), system control (mouse/keyboard), game window detection, positioning/scaling utilities.
- **`genshin`** (`genshin_scanner`) — Genshin-specific scanner logic: GOOD v3 scanners for characters, weapons, and artifacts. Handles in-game navigation, panel OCR, and name matching via remote mappings.
- **`application`** (`good_tools_app`) — Binary crate. Two targets: `GOODScanner.exe` (OCR scanner, default) and `GOODCapture.exe` (packet capture scanner, behind `capture` feature flag).

### How Scanning Works

1. User opens Genshin Impact and navigates to the appropriate screen
2. `GenshinGameController` captures the game window and provides scaled coordinates
3. `BackpackScanner` navigates the grid inventory (weapons/artifacts)
4. Individual scanners OCR each panel's fields (name, level, stats, etc.)
5. OCR results are fuzzy-matched against `MappingManager` data (fetched from ggartifact.com)
6. Results are exported as GOOD v3 JSON

### Config File (`good_config.json`)

On first run, a bilingual prompt asks for custom in-game names for Traveler/Wanderer/Manekin/Manekina (renameable characters). The JSON file is created next to the exe with these names plus all timing/delay defaults:

```json
{
  "traveler_name": "",
  "wanderer_name": "",
  "manekin_name": "",
  "manekina_name": "",
  "char_tab_delay": 500,
  "char_next_delay": 300,
  "char_open_delay": 1500,
  "char_close_delay": 500,
  "inv_scroll_delay": 200,
  "inv_tab_delay": 400,
  "inv_open_delay": 1500,
  "capture_delay": 40
}
```

Existing config files without delay fields are loaded correctly via `#[serde(default)]` and re-saved with new defaults. Old per-scanner field names (`weapon_grid_delay`, `artifact_grid_delay`, etc.) are accepted via serde aliases for backwards compatibility.

## Build & Run

```bash
# Stable Rust toolchain
rustup default stable

# Build
cargo build --release

# The binary is at target/release/GOODScanner.exe
# Run with default (scan artifacts):
GOODScanner.exe

# Scan everything:
GOODScanner.exe --all

# Scan specific categories:
GOODScanner.exe --characters --weapons --artifacts
```

Requires administrator privileges on Windows (for input simulation).

## CLI Flags

All help text is bilingual (Chinese + English). Flags are grouped into four sections:

### Scan Targets
- `--characters` / `--weapons` / `--artifacts` / `--all`

### Global Options
- `-v, --verbose` — detailed scan info
- `--continue-on-failure` — keep scanning when individual items fail
- `--log-progress` — log each scanned item
- `--output-dir <DIR>` — output directory (default: `.`)
- `--ocr-backend <NAME>` — override OCR backend globally (ppocrv4 or ppocrv5)
- `--dump-images` — save OCR region screenshots to `debug_images/`

### Scanner Config
- `--weapon-min-rarity <N>` — min weapon rarity (default: 3)
- `--artifact-min-rarity <N>` — min artifact rarity (default: 4)
- `--char-max-count <N>` / `--weapon-max-count <N>` / `--artifact-max-count <N>` — max items (0 = unlimited)
- `--weapon-skip-delay` / `--artifact-skip-delay` — skip panel delay (faster but less reliable lock/astral detection)
- `--artifact-substat-ocr <NAME>` — substat/general OCR backend (default: ppocrv4)

### Debug
- `--debug-compare <PATH>` — groundtruth JSON comparison
- `--debug-actual <PATH>` — offline diff (no scanning)
- `--debug-start-at <N>` — skip to item index
- `--debug-char-index <N>` — jump to character index
- `--debug-timing` — per-field OCR timing
- `--debug-rescan-pos <R,C>` — re-scan a grid position
- `--debug-rescan-type <TYPE>` — scanner type for re-scan (default: weapon)
- `--debug-rescan-count <N>` — re-scan iterations (0 = infinite until RMB)

### Architecture Notes
- Character names are set via first-run prompt → `good_config.json` only (no CLI flags)
- Timing/delay settings live in `good_config.json` only (no CLI flags)
- Per-scanner verbose/dump/continue/log flags consolidated into global flags
- Per-scanner configs are plain structs (no clap derives); the orchestrator (`cli.rs`) populates them from global CLI flags + JSON config

## Dependencies & Platform

- **OCR**: ONNX Runtime (`ort` crate) with PaddleOCR models (embedded via `include_bytes!`)
- **Screen capture**: `screenshots` crate (with Win32 BitBlt primary path on Windows)
- **Input simulation**: `enigo` crate
- **Remote mappings**: `reqwest` (blocking HTTP to ggartifact.com)
- **Windows only**: Requires admin, uses Win32 APIs for window detection

## Conventions

- All UI coordinates use 1920x1080 as base resolution, scaled at runtime via `CoordScaler`
- Chinese (zh_CN) game client only — OCR models trained on Chinese game text
- GOOD v3 format spec: keys use PascalCase (e.g., `"SkywardHarp"`, `"Furina"`)
- The `data/` directory (gitignored) caches remote mapping files

## Manager & HTTP Server

### Architecture

Two-thread model: HTTP thread (tiny_http) handles requests, execution thread owns the game controller and processes jobs sequentially. Communication via `mpsc` channel + `Arc<Mutex<JobState>>`.

### Data flow

1. Client sends `POST /manage`, `POST /equip`, or `POST /scan` → server validates, returns 202 with `jobId`
2. Client polls `GET /status` for progress
3. Execution thread processes the job (manage/equip/scan)
4. Client fetches `GET /result?jobId=xxx` (idempotent) for final results
5. Client fetches scanned data via `GET /characters?jobId=xxx`, `GET /weapons?jobId=xxx`, `GET /artifacts[?jobId=xxx]`

### API Reference

Endpoints (summary only — full contract, request/response shapes, status codes, and worked examples live in [`docs/MANAGER_API.md`](docs/MANAGER_API.md); update that file when the wire contract changes):

- `POST /manage` — lock/unlock artifacts. Returns 202 with `jobId`.
- `POST /equip` — equip/unequip artifacts. Returns 202 with `jobId`.
- `POST /scan` — OCR scan for characters/weapons/artifacts. Returns 202; one `jobId` covers all requested categories.
- `GET /status` — poll job state. Manage/equip expose `progress` (linear, per-item). Scan exposes `scanProgress` (per-category, one slot each, `pending`/`running`/`complete`/`aborted`).
- `GET /result?jobId=xxx` — final per-instruction results + summary.
- `GET /characters?jobId=xxx`, `GET /weapons?jobId=xxx` — scan data. 503 if that jobId attempted the category but didn't finish.
- `GET /artifacts[?jobId=xxx]` — scan data or manage snapshot. `jobId` optional for back-compat.
- `GET /health` — `{status, enabled, busy, gameAlive}`.

#### `GET /health` — Health check
Returns `{"status":"ok","enabled":bool,"busy":bool,"gameAlive":bool}`.

### Data Caching

Each data type (characters, weapons, artifacts) has an independent `ScanDataCache<T>` storing the latest `(jobId, data)` plus an `incomplete_job_id` slot. All-or-nothing: a scan category populates the cache only if it completes in full during that run; if it aborts/errors/is never reached, the jobId is recorded as incomplete and the cache isn't written — queries for that jobId return 503. Categories the client didn't request leave the cache untouched. Manage/equip jobs that modify in-game state invalidate the artifact cache before execution.

### Key config flow

GUI `state.update_inventory` (bool, default true) → inverted to `stop_on_all_matched` → passed through `cli.rs::run_server_core()` → `ArtifactManager::new()` → `LockManager::execute()`.

### Matching (matching.rs)

All fields are hard-match (reject on mismatch): set, slot, rarity, level, main stat, elixir_crafted, substats, unactivated substats. Substat values allow 0.1 tolerance for OCR rounding. `location`, `lock`, `astral_mark` are NOT matched (they change independently of artifact identity).

### Lock toggle flow (lock_manager.rs)

Per-page: scan all items via pipelined OCR → match against targets → re-click matched positions → toggle lock → verify pixel. Page-skip optimization: in fast mode, OCR the last item's level first; if > max target level, skip the page entirely (inventory sorted by level descending).

### Snapshot (orchestrator.rs)

After a complete manage scan, builds an artifact snapshot reflecting post-toggle state: updates `lock` and clears `astral_mark` on unlock (game forces this). Served via `GET /artifacts?jobId=xxx`.

## Fuzzy Matching (`fuzzy_match.rs`)

5-tier fallback for matching OCR text against name→key maps:

1. **OCR confusion substitution** — char-by-char replacement of known misreads (e.g., 稚→薙, 拉→菈). Tries each pair individually, then applies ALL applicable substitutions simultaneously (needed when OCR garbles multiple chars, e.g. 菈乌玛→拉鸟玛 requires both 拉→菈 and 鸟→乌).
2. **Exact match** on cleaned/normalized text
3. **Substring match** (both directions: OCR added noise, or OCR truncated)
4. **Levenshtein distance** (30% threshold, char-level for CJK)
5. **LCS uniqueness fallback** (≥2 shared CJK chars, unique to one candidate)

### Adding OCR Confusion Pairs

In `OCR_CONFUSIONS` array. Rules:
- Only add `(wrong, correct)` where `wrong` does NOT appear as a standalone char in any legitimate name — otherwise exact match on that name would never be reached (the substitution would mangle it). Even if the substitution doesn't match, it wastes a lookup. Chars with collisions (菈↔莱, 鹮↔鹤/环) rely on Tier 4/5 instead.
- All current pairs are single-char to single-char. The combined pass assumes this.
- The combined pass applies all substitutions in one char-by-char sweep, avoiding cascading issues with bidirectional pairs (e.g., 茲↔兹).

## Artifact Scanner Details

### Dual-Engine OCR Pipeline

The artifact scanner uses two OCR backends (based on systematic eval — v4 dominates all fields except level):
- **Level engine** (ppocrv5, `--ocr-backend`): Only used for artifact level OCR ("+20" style text). v5 is 100% vs v4's 39.4% on level.
- **General engine** (ppocrv4, `--artifact-substat-ocr`): Used for everything else — name, main stat, set, equip, substats. v4 is strictly better on all these fields.

Level uses dual-engine (tries both, takes max valid). Substats use only the general engine (v4). Results are collected as `OcrCandidate` lists per line, then validated by the roll solver.

Weapon and character scanners use a single engine (v4 by default).

### Roll Solver (`roll_solver.rs`)

Validates substat combinations against game mechanics:
- Uses pre-computed **rollTable** lookup (from `rollTable.json` via `roll_table.rs`) — NOT brute-force f64 enumeration
- Each entry is `(display_value×10: i32, roll_count_bitmask: u8)`, binary searched
- Validates total roll count = init_count + level/4
- **Init preference**: Level 0 → prefer higher init first (lines = init count); Level > 0 → prefer lower init (better accuracy)
- Outputs `totalRolls`, `initialValue` per substat, and `inactive` flag
- The solver treats inactive (待激活) substats identically to active ones — their values are real roll values

### Elixir Crafted Detection

Elixir artifacts display a purple banner ("祝圣之霜定义") that shifts all content down by 40px (`ELIXIR_SHIFT`).
- Detection: 3 pixels at (1510, 1520, 1530), y=423 — checks for purple (blue > 230 && blue > green + 40)
- **Do NOT move to x=1683** — that hits the lock icon and causes massive false positives
- When detected, all subsequent OCR regions are Y-shifted by 40px

### Substat Crop Regions

- Lines 0–2: width 255px (calibrated to avoid OCR noise from wider crops)
- Line 3: width 355px (wider to capture "(待激活)" text on unactivated substats)
- All start at x=1356

### Unactivated Substats (待激活)

- Appear on level-0 artifacts as the 4th substat line with muted font and "(待激活)" appended
- The stat key and value are real (not zero) — it's the value that WILL be added on first level-up
- `stat_parser.rs` detects "(待激活)" text and sets `ParsedStat.inactive = true`, keeping the real value
- `OcrCandidate.inactive` propagates through the solver to `SolvedSubstat.inactive`
- Scanner splits solver results into `substats` (active) and `unactivated_substats` (inactive) in the output

### Pixel-Based Detection (highly reliable)

- **Rarity**: Star pixel color at fixed Y positions
- **Lock**: Pixel color at `ARTIFACT_LOCK_POS1` (1683, 428)
- **Elixir**: Purple banner check at (1510–1530, 423)
- **Astral mark**: Pixel at `ARTIFACT_ASTRAL_POS1`

### Parallelization

- `OcrPool`: Channel-based pool of N OCR model instances
- `scan_worker`: Generic parallel worker for backpack grid items
- **ALWAYS create separate pools** for main and substat OCR (sharing causes deadlock: N tasks each hold 1 instance, all waiting for a 2nd)

## GOODCapture (Packet Capture Scanner)

GOODCapture is a **separate binary** (`GOODCapture.exe`) that exports GOOD v3 data by sniffing game network packets instead of OCR. It is separated from GOODScanner.exe to avoid antivirus false positives (mixing packet capture with input simulation triggers heuristics).

### Build

```bash
cargo build --release --features capture --bin GOODCapture
```

### How It Works

1. Uses `pktmon` (Windows packet monitor) to capture UDP traffic on ports 22101–22102
2. `GameSniffer` (from `auto-artifactarium` crate) decrypts packets using dispatch keys from `keys/gi.json`
3. `CaptureMonitor` uses **heuristic field-number-agnostic matching** — parses outer protobuf as generic `Unk`, tries every repeated length-delimited field as `Item` or `AvatarInfo`, picks the best match. This survives both command ID rotation AND outer field number changes across game versions.
4. Auto-stops when both character and item packets are received
5. `PlayerData` converts captured data → GOOD v3 JSON

### Dispatch Keys (`keys/gi.json`)

- `HashMap<u16, String>` mapping game version → base64-encoded key
- External key file (`keys/gi.json` next to exe) overrides embedded keys, allowing updates without recompiling
- Keys are per game version, NOT per server channel — same keys work for official (官服) and Bilibili (B服) servers

### Dependencies (capture-only)

- `auto-artifactarium` — packet decryption + protobuf types (from konkers/auto-artifactarium)
- `pktmon` — Windows packet monitor driver interface
- `protobuf` — protobuf parsing
- `tokio` — async runtime for capture loop

## Testing & Validation

### Groundtruth

- `genshin_export.json`: Exported via third-party tool, contains complete artifact/character/weapon data
- Note: GT uses typo `elixerCrafted` (not `elixirCrafted`) — diff report handles both

### Diff Report (`diff_report.py`)

- Compares scan output against groundtruth with Hungarian algorithm matching
- Groups by `(setKey, slotKey, rarity, lock)` — rarity and lock are hard matching requirements (pixel-based, very reliable)
- Three-tier categorization: non-stat diffs, stat-key diffs, stat-value-only diffs
- Always run scans with `--dump-images` so dump images match the scan output
- Use `python diff_report.py <scan.json> <gt.json>` to generate `diff_report.md`

### Other Scripts

- `test_solver.py`: Validates roll solver against groundtruth (expects ~99.7% totalRolls accuracy)
- `gen_roll_table.py`: Generates `roll_table.rs` from `rollTable.json`

### Key Calibration Values

| Parameter | Value | Notes |
|-----------|-------|-------|
| Substat width (lines 0–2) | 255px | Wider causes OCR failures |
| Substat width (line 3) | 355px | Captures "(待激活)" text |
| delay_after_panel | 100ms | Lock/astral mark animation |
| Talent overview width | 90px | Supports 2-digit levels |
| ELIXIR_SHIFT | 40px | Purple banner height |
| Elixir pixel positions | (1510–1530, 423) | Do NOT use x=1683 |
